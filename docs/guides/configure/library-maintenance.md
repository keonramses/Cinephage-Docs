## Disk Space Management

### Monitor usage

```

Shows:
- Per root folder usage
- Free space remaining
- Largest items

### Cleanup strategies

1. **Unmonitor Unwanted Items:**
   - Stop searching for old series
   - Keep files but disable monitoring

2. **Delete Unwatched:**
   - Review play history
   - Delete items never watched
   - Use "Delete Files & Remove" action

3. **Quality Cleanup:**
   - Keep only best quality
   - Delete lower quality duplicates
   - Use "Organize" to consolidate

4. **Export List:**
   - Export library to CSV
   - Analyze outside Cinephage
   - Identify candidates for deletion

## Best Practices

### Organization

1. **Use Meaningful Root Folder Names:**
   - "Movies" not "Media"
   - "TV Shows" not "Series"

2. **Keep Paths Simple:**
   - `/media/movies` not `/home/user/media/collection/movies/final`

3. **Separate by Type:**
   - Don't mix movies and TV
   - Consider anime separately
   - Kids content in dedicated folder

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Scans:**
   - Enable automatic scanning
   - Or scan weekly manually

2. **Monitor Disk Space:**
   - Set up alerts
   - Plan storage expansion

3. **Keep Backups:**
   - Database backup weekly
   - Configuration backup monthly

4. **Clean Regularly:**
   - Review blocklist monthly
   - Clean up failed downloads
   - Archive old logs

### Performance

1. **SSD for Config:**
   - Database on fast storage
   - Media can be on slower storage

2. **Optimize Database:**
   - VACUUM monthly
   - ANALYZE weekly

3. **Limit Library Size:**
   - Realistic collection size
   - Quality over quantity
