## Provider Types Explained

### Stalker Portal (MAG/Ministra)

Stalker (also known as Ministra) is an IPTV middleware system used by many IPTV providers. It's commonly used with MAG set-top boxes.

**How It Works:**
- Provider gives you a portal URL and MAC address
- Cinephage authenticates using the MAC address
- Retrieves channel list, EPG, and account info from portal

**Key Features:**
-  Full EPG support
-  Archive/Catch-up TV
-  Portal scanning for discovery
-  Account expiration tracking
-  Built-in authentication

**Required Information:**
- Portal URL (e.g., `http://portal.example.com/c`)
- MAC Address (format: `00:1A:79:XX:XX:XX`)

### XStream Codes

XStream Codes is a popular IPTV panel system used by many providers. Accounts use username/password authentication.

**How It Works:**
- Provider gives you server URL, username, and password
- Cinephage authenticates via XStream API

## Discovering Stalker Accounts

If you have a Stalker portal but don't have valid credentials, Cinephage can scan for working MAC addresses.

### How Portal Scanning Works

The scanner tests MAC addresses against a Stalker portal to find valid accounts:

1. Generates or imports MAC addresses
2. Attempts authentication with each
3. Records successful connections
4. Displays discovered accounts with expiration dates
5. Allows you to approve accounts for use

### Starting a Scan

1. Ensure you have at least one Stalker account configured (or add portal URL)
2. Go to **Live TV > Accounts**
3. Click **Scan for Accounts**
4. Select scan type:

#### Scan Type: Random

Generates random MAC addresses using known STB manufacturer prefixes:

- **MAC Prefix** - Choose manufacturer prefix (e.g., `00:1A:79`)
- **Number to Test** - How many addresses to generate (10-1000)
- **Parallel Workers** - Concurrent scans (1-10)

#### Scan Type: Sequential

Tests a specific range of MAC addresses:

- **Start MAC** - Starting MAC address
- **End MAC** - Ending MAC address
- **Step Size** - Increment between addresses

#### Scan Type: Import

Tests a list of MAC addresses you provide:

- Paste MAC addresses (one per line)
- Or upload a text file

### During the Scan

The scanner shows real-time progress:

- **Tested** - Number of MACs checked
- **Found** - Valid accounts discovered
- **Failed** - Invalid or expired accounts
- **Progress Bar** - Visual progress indicator

:::tip Scanning Ethics
Only scan portals you have permission to access. Unauthorized scanning may violate terms of service.
:::

### Reviewing Discovered Accounts

After scanning completes:

1. Review the list of discovered accounts
2. Check account details:
   - Expiration date
   - Package/subscription info
   - Number of connections allowed
3. Select accounts to approve
4. Click **Approve Selected**

Approved accounts are added to your Live TV accounts and can be used immediately.

## Syncing Channels

After adding an account, you need to sync channels from the provider.

### Manual Channel Sync

1. Go to **Live TV > Accounts**
2. Find your account in the list
3. Click **Sync Channels** button
4. Wait for sync to complete

**What Gets Synced:**

- Channel names and numbers
- Categories/groups
- Stream URLs
- Channel logos (if available)
- EPG channel IDs
- Archive/catch-up availability (Stalker)

### What Happens During Sync

1. Cinephage connects to provider
2. Requests channel list
3. Parses and normalizes channel data
4. Downloads channel logos
5. Updates database with channel information
6. Shows sync results (channels added/updated/removed)

:::note Sync Duration
Sync time depends on number of channels:
- Small lists (100 channels): ~10-30 seconds
- Medium lists (500 channels): ~1-2 minutes
- Large lists (2000+ channels): ~3-5 minutes
:::

### Auto-Sync

Some providers support automatic channel synchronization:

- **Stalker:** Channels sync when you access Live TV
