# Handle failed downloads

This guide explains how to handle failed downloads and use the blocklist effectively to prevent repeated issues.

## Understanding Download Failures

Downloads can fail for many reasons. Understanding the cause helps determine the right solution.

### Common failure types

| Failure Type | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Download Client Error** | Connection issue, disk full, permissions | Check download client |
| **Import Failure** | Permissions, file locked, path issues | Check file system |
| **Missing Files** | NZB/torrent incomplete, DMCA takedown | Try alternative release |
| **Quality Rejected** | File doesn't match expected quality | Adjust quality profile |
| **Custom Format Rejected** | Doesn't meet format requirements | Review Custom Formats |
| **Unknown Movie/Episode** | Can't parse release name | Manual import or skip |

## The Activity Page

Your first stop for managing downloads is the **Activity** section.

### Activity overview

Navigate to **Activity** to see:

- **Queue** - Current downloads in progress
- **History** - Completed and failed downloads
- **Blocklist** - Releases marked as problematic

### Reading the queue

The queue shows active downloads:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Queue (3 items)                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ The Matrix (1999)                                           │
│   Status: Downloading - 45% @ 2.5 MB/s                      │
│   Client: qBittorrent                                       │
│   Time Left: 12 minutes                                     │
│                                                             │
│ Breaking Bad S01E01                                         │
│   Status: Paused                                            │
│   Client: SABnzbd                                           │
│   Action: Resume                                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Columns Explained:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Movie or episode name |
| **Status** | Current download state |
| **Progress** | Percentage complete |
| **Client** | Which download client |
| **Actions** | Available actions (pause, remove, etc.) |

### Understanding history

History shows completed downloads and their outcomes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ History                                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Inception (2010)                                            │
│   Event: Imported                                           │
│   Quality: 1080p BluRay                                     │
│   Date: 2024-01-15 14:30                                    │
│                                                             │
│ The Dark Knight (2008)                                      │
│   Event: Failed - Download incomplete                       │
│   Reason: Articles missing from server                      │
│   Date: 2024-01-15 13:45                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Event Types:**

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Grabbed** | Download started |
| **Imported** | Successfully added to library |
| **Failed** | Download failed |
| **Upgrade** | Replaced with better quality |
| **Deleted** | File deleted from library |

## Handling Failed Downloads

### Step 1: identify the failure

When a download fails:

1. Go to **Activity > History**
2. Find the failed item (red icon)
3. Click to expand details
4. Note the **failure reason**

**Common Failure Reasons:**

```
 "Download failed: Disk full"
   → Check download client disk space

 "Import failed: Access denied"
   → Check file permissions

 "No files found"
   → NZB/torrent was empty or deleted

 "Manual intervention required"
   → Check download client for issues

 "Release marked as failed"
   → Blocked due to previous failure
```

### Step 2: check the download client

Many failures originate in the download client:

**For qBittorrent:**

1. Open qBittorrent web UI
2. Check torrent status:
   - Stalled: No seeds available
   - Error: Connection/tracker issue
   - Missing files: Deleted or moved
3. Review error messages

**For SABnzbd:**

1. Open SABnzbd web UI
2. Check queue and history
3. Look for:
   - "Missing articles" - Incomplete NZB
   - "Failed repair" - PAR2 couldn't fix
   - "Verification failed" - Password protected
4. Review server status

### Step 3: take appropriate action

Based on the failure type:

#### Disk Space Issues

**Problem:** Download client out of space

**Solution:**
1. Free up disk space on download drive
2. Check Cinephage import settings
3. Verify completed downloads are being removed
4. Consider larger storage

#### Permission Issues

**Problem:** Cinephage can't access files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /path/to/downloads
ls -la /path/to/media

# Fix permissions (Linux/Docker)
chmod -R 755 /path/to/media
chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/media  # Adjust IDs as needed
```

**Docker-specific:**
- Ensure PUID/PGID match your user
- Volume mounts use correct paths
- Check container can access both directories

#### Incomplete Downloads

**Problem:** NZB is incomplete or torrent has no seeds

**Solution:**
1. Wait for more sources (torrents may gain seeds)
2. Try alternative release
3. Check if release is still available on indexer
4. Consider blocklisting and searching again

#### Wrong Content

**Problem:** Downloaded file doesn't match expected movie/episode

**Solution:**
1. Verify file contents manually
2. If wrong content:
   - Remove from download client
   - Add to blocklist (prevent re-download)
   - Search for correct release

### Step 4: retry or search alternative

After fixing the issue, you have options:

**Option 1: Automatic Retry**

If task hasn't run yet, wait for:
- Missing Content Search task
- Cutoff Unmet Search task
- RSS Sync

**Option 2: Manual Search**

Force immediate search:

1. Go to movie/episode page
2. Click **Search** button
3. Cinephage searches indexers
4. Select alternative release

**Option 3: Alternative Release**

From Activity:

1. Find failed item in History
2. Click **Search Again**
3. Review alternative releases
4. Select different quality/source

## Using the Blocklist

### What is the blocklist?

The blocklist prevents problematic releases from being downloaded again:

**When Items Are Blocklisted:**
-  Download failed
-  Wrong content
-  Bad quality
-  Manually added by user

**Blocklist Behavior:**
- Blocked releases are skipped in searches
- They won't appear in search results
- RSS sync ignores them
- They don't count against indexer limits

### Automatic blocklisting

Cinephage automatically adds releases to blocklist when:

1. **Download fails** - Client reports failure
2. **Import fails** - Can't import after multiple attempts
3. **Wrong content** - Manual marking
4. **Release deleted** - File removed by user

### Manual blocklisting

Add releases to blocklist manually:

**From History:**

1. Go to **Activity > History**
2. Find the release
3. Click **Blocklist** button
4. Confirm addition

**From Search Results:**

1. Search for content
2. Find problematic release
3. Click **Blocklist** icon
4. Release won't appear in future searches

**From Queue:**

1. Go to **Activity > Queue**
2. Find active download
3. Click **Remove & Blocklist**
4. Stops download and prevents retry

### Viewing the blocklist

Access blocklisted releases:

1. Go to **Activity > Blocklist**
2. See all blocked releases
3. Columns include:
   - Release title
   - Blocked date
   - Reason for block
   - Source indexer

### Managing the blocklist

**Remove from Blocklist:**

If you want to allow a release again:

1. Go to **Activity > Blocklist**
2. Find the release
3. Click **Remove** or checkbox + **Remove Selected**
4. Release can be downloaded again

**Clear Entire Blocklist:**

1. Click **Clear All**
2. Confirm deletion
3. All releases unblocked

:::warning[Use Sparingly]
Only clear blocklist if you understand why items were blocked. Clearing may result in re-downloading problematic releases.
:::

### Blocklist best practices

**Do Blocklist:**
-  Releases with wrong content
-  Consistently failing releases
-  Releases from untrusted sources
-  Poor quality encodes

**Don't Blocklist:**
-  Temporary failures (connection issues)
-  Releases that might work later (torrents gaining seeds)
-  Single failures that might be one-off

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk clear failed downloads

Clear multiple failed items from the queue at once:

**Step 1: Access Bulk Clear**

1. Go to **Activity > Queue**
2. Click **Filter** and select **Failed**
3. Select multiple items using checkboxes
4. Click **Clear Failed** button

**Step 2: Confirm Bulk Clear**

A confirmation modal appears:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Clear Failed Downloads                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ You are about to remove 15 failed items:                    │
│                                                              │
│  - The Matrix (1999) - Missing articles                     │
│  - Inception (2010) - Download incomplete                    │
│  - Avatar (2009) - Disk full                                │
│                                                              │
│ These items will be removed from the queue.                   │
│ (Blocked status depends on your settings)                     │
│                                                              │
│ [ ] Also add to blocklist                                    │
│                                                              │
│                    [Cancel]  [Clear 15 Items]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 3: Choose Blocklist Option**

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Unchecked** | Items removed from queue only, can be re-searched |
| **Checked** | Items removed AND added to blocklist to prevent re-download |

**Step 4: Complete**

Click **Clear 15 Items** to confirm.

:::warning[Blocklist Warning]
If you check "Also add to blocklist," these releases will be skipped in future searches. Only enable this for releases that genuinely won't work.
:::

### Bulk clear from activity

You can also access bulk clear from **Activity > History**:

1. Filter to show failed items only
2. Click **Select All** or pick specific items
3. Click **Clear Selected**
4. Confirm the bulk operation

### API endpoint for bulk clear

Use the queue API to programmatically clear failed downloads:

```bash
# Clear all failed items
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-api-key: cinephage_your_key_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/queue/clear-failed

# Response
{
  "success": true,
  "clearedCount": 15,
  "blocklistAdded": 0
}
```

### Queue cleanup API

The queue cleanup endpoint removes old completed items:

```bash
# Cleanup queue (removes old completed items)
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-api-key: cinephage_your_key_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/queue/cleanup
```

This is useful for:
- Removing old completed downloads from history
- Keeping the queue manageable
- Automating maintenance via cron

## Advanced Failure Management

### Failed download handling settings

Configure automatic failure handling:

1. Go to **Settings > Media Management > Failed Downloads**
2. Configure:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Auto-Retry** | Automatically retry failed downloads | Enabled |
| **Retry Attempts** | How many times to retry | 3 |
| **Retry Delay** | Wait time between retries | 30 minutes |
| **Redownload** | Search for alternative after max retries | Enabled |

### Release rejection analysis

Understand why releases are rejected:

**From Search Results:**

Hover over rejected releases to see reason:

```
 Blocklisted
   → Previously marked as failed

 Quality Rejected
   → Below minimum quality in profile

 Custom Format Rejected
   → Doesn't meet format requirements

 Age Rejected
   → Too old for delay profile

 Size Rejected
   → Outside size limits
```

**From Logs:**

Detailed rejection reasons in logs:

```bash
# View rejection logs
docker logs cinephage | grep -i reject

# Or native
journalctl -u cinephage | grep -i reject
```

### Manual import after failure

If automatic import fails, try manual import:

1. Go to **Activity > Queue**
2. Find failed item
3. Click **Manual Import**
4. Browse to downloaded files
5. Match files to correct movie/episode
6. Click **Import**

**When to Use:**
- File name couldn't be parsed automatically
- Wrong content detected but actually correct
- Import keeps failing but files are valid

## Troubleshooting Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: repeated failures for same item

**Problem:** Same movie/episode keeps failing different releases

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Activity > History for patterns
2. Look for common failure reasons
3. Verify quality profile settings
4. Check indexer availability

**Solutions:**

```
If all releases fail with "Missing articles":
  → Content may be too old for provider retention
  → Try different indexer
  → Consider download age limit

If all releases fail with "Import error":
  → Check file permissions
  → Verify root folder paths
  → Review import method settings

If quality keeps being rejected:
  → Adjust quality profile minimums
  → Check custom format scores
  → Review release size limits
```

### Scenario 2: blocklist growing too large

**Problem:** Blocklist has hundreds or thousands of entries

**Impact:**
- Slower search performance
- Higher memory usage
- Cluttered interface

**Solutions:**

1. **Review Blocklist Regularly:**
   - Remove old entries (>1 year)
   - Keep only problematic releases
   - Clear entries for resolved issues

2. **Prevent Unnecessary Blocks:**
   - Don't block temporary failures
   - Allow retry before blocking
   - Check if issue is systemic

3. **Bulk Cleanup:**
   - Export blocklist for review
   - Clear all and start fresh
   - Import only problematic ones

### Scenario 3: good releases getting blocked

**Problem:** Legitimate releases are being blocked

**Causes:**
- Over-aggressive blocklisting
- Similar names to bad releases
- Automatic block on false failure

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Blocklist Reason:**
   - Was it manual or automatic?
   - What was the failure reason?
   - Is pattern repeating?

2. **Remove from Blocklist:**
   ```
   Activity > Blocklist > Find release > Remove
   ```

3. **Search Again:**
   - Try the release again
   - Monitor for success
   - If fails again, investigate root cause

### Scenario 4: download completes but won't import

**Problem:** File downloads successfully but import fails repeatedly

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
# Fix ownership
chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/media

# Fix permissions
chmod -R u+w /path/to/media
```

**Disk Full:**
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h

# Clean up if needed
rm -rf /path/to/temp/files
```

**File Locked:**
- Wait for download client to release file
- Check if file is being scanned by antivirus
- Verify no other process has file open

**Path Issues:**
- Check root folder path is correct
- Verify Docker volume mounts
- Ensure path exists and is writable

**Video File Issues:**
- Corrupt file (try playing in VLC)
- Wrong format (check file extension)
- DRM protected (can't import)

## Best Practices

### Preventing failures

1. **Proper Configuration:**
   - Set correct root folder paths
   - Configure download client properly
   - Use appropriate quality profiles
   - Set reasonable size limits

2. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Monitor disk space
   - Review blocklist monthly
   - Check download client health
   - Update indexers regularly

3. **Smart Blocklisting:**
   - Only block truly problematic releases
   - Document why items are blocked
   - Review blocklist periodically
   - Clear resolved issues

### When failures happen

1. **Don't Panic:**
   - Most failures are temporary
   - Alternative releases usually available
   - No data is lost

2. **Systematic Approach:**
   - Identify failure type
   - Check relevant systems
   - Apply appropriate fix
   - Monitor for resolution

3. **Learn from Patterns:**
   - Are failures indexer-specific?
   - Is it always the same error?
   - Time-based patterns?
   - Use patterns to prevent future issues
