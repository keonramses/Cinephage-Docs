## Part 6: Handling Search Results

### No results found

If search returns nothing:

1. **Check indexers:**
   - Verify indexers are enabled
   - Test indexer connections
   - Check indexer categories

2. **Try different search:**
   - Search by TMDB ID (in URL: `/discover/movie/27205`)
   - Use alternate titles
   - Wait and try later (new releases)

3. **Check filters:**
   - Remove quality filters temporarily
   - Check Custom Formats are not blocking
   - Verify language settings

### Too many results

If overwhelmed with results:

1. **Apply filters:**
   - Filter by minimum score
   - Filter by resolution
   - Filter by source

2. **Sort appropriately:**
   - Sort by score to see best first
   - Sort by size for storage concerns

3. **Refine quality profile:**
   - Tighten Custom Formats
   - Adjust scoring rules
   - Block unwanted sources

### Low scores

If best score is low:

1. **Check quality profile:**
   - Verify profile assigned to item
   - Check cutoff settings
   - Review custom format scores

2. **Consider waiting:**
   - Better releases may appear later
   - Enable upgrade monitoring
   - Set appropriate cutoff

## Part 7: After Grab

5. Notifications sent (if configured)

### Failed downloads

If download fails:

4. Release may be auto-blocklisted
5. Next search will try different release

## Part 8: Search Best Practices

For the best search results:

- **Quality over Speed** - Wait for quality releases rather than grabbing first available; use cutoff settings to prevent endless upgrading
- **Diversify Indexers** - Use multiple indexers for better content coverage and redundancy
- **Monitor, Don't Just Search** - Enable monitoring on items and let automatic search work in the background
- **Respect Rate Limits** - Indexers have API limits; use reasonable monitoring intervals (default: hourly)
- **Review Before Grabbing** - Check release names, file sizes, and release groups when selecting manually

**Learn more:** See [Search System](/explanation/search-system) for detailed conceptual guidance on search best practices.

## Troubleshooting

### Searches take too long

**Problem:** Searching is very slow

**Solutions:**

- Reduce number of enabled indexers
- Disable slow indexers
- Check network connectivity
- Increase indexer timeout settings

### Results not appearing

**Problem:** No results from working indexers

**Solutions:**

- Check indexer categories are correct
- Verify API keys are valid
- Test indexer individually
- Check for indexer site issues

### Wrong quality downloaded

**Problem:** Lower quality than expected

**Solutions:**

- Check quality profile assigned
- Verify cutoff is set correctly
- Review custom format scores
- Check if better release was filtered

### Cannot grab release

**Problem:** Grab button does nothing or errors

**Solutions:**

- Check download client connection
- Verify download client has space
- Check path mappings
- Review download client logs
