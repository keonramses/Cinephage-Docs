# General Questions

### What is Cinephage?

Cinephage is a unified, self-hosted media management platform that handles movies, TV shows, live TV, and streaming in one modern web interface. It combines content discovery, searching, downloading, and subtitle management into a single application with a single database.

### What can Cinephage do?

Cinephage provides comprehensive media management capabilities:

- **Movies** - Library management, monitoring, quality profiles, automatic downloads
- **TV Shows** - Episode tracking, season packs, automatic episode searches
- **Indexer Management** - YAML-based indexer definitions, built-in and custom support
- **Subtitles** - 11 subtitle providers with automatic syncing
- **Requests & Discovery** - Browse trending content, manage watchlists
- **Live TV & Streaming** - Live TV support via Stalker, XStream, M3U playlists

### Is Cinephage free?

Yes! Cinephage is 100% free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. There are no premium features, no subscriptions, and no paywalls.

### What are the advantages of Cinephage?

- Single unified application
- One database for all media types
- Consistent UI/UX across all features
- Lower resource usage (200-500MB typical)
- Straightforward setup and configuration
- Consistent automation rules

**Trade-off:** Unified design covers most common use cases; users needing highly specialized configurations per media type may prefer modular approaches.

### Can I import my existing media library?

Yes, you can import your existing library:
1. Configure Root Folders in Cinephage
2. Use Import feature to scan existing files
3. Cinephage will match to TMDB

Your files stay in place - Cinephage just creates its own database entries.
