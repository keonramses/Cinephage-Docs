# Troubleshooting

### Where are the logs?

**Docker:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f cinephage
```

**Web Interface:**
```
Settings → System → Logs
```

**Log Files:**
```
./config/logs/cinephage.log
```

### How do I enable debug logging?

**Docker:**
```yaml
environment:
  - LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**Restart required:**
```bash
docker compose restart
```

### My database is getting large, what should I do?

**Check size:**
```bash
ls -lh ./config/data/cinephage.db
```

**Optimize:**
```bash
# Docker
docker exec cinephage sqlite3 /config/data/cinephage.db "VACUUM;"

# Native
sqlite3 ./data/cinephage.db "VACUUM;"
```

**Set retention:**
```
Settings → System → Data Retention
```

### Cinephage won't start, what do I do?

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs cinephage
```

**Common issues:**
1. **Port already in use** - Change port mapping
2. **Database locked** - Check no other instance running
3. **Permission denied** - Fix PUID/PGID or file permissions
4. **Out of memory** - Increase Docker memory limit

**Reset (last resort):**
```bash
# Backup first
cp -r ./config ./config-backup

# Reset database
docker compose down
rm ./config/data/cinephage.db
docker compose up -d
```

### How do I reset my password?

If you can't log in:

1. Stop Cinephage
2. Delete user from database (advanced) or
3. Reset entire database (loses all data) or
4. Use CLI reset command (if available)

### Why are my subtitle searches failing?

**Check:**
1. Subtitle providers configured
2. Language profile includes desired languages
3. Video file name is clear (not obfuscated)
4. Subtitle providers have the language

### Can I use a VPN?

Yes, but don't use Cinephage's built-in VPN (there isn't one). Instead:

**Option 1: VPN Container**
```yaml
services:
  gluetun:  # VPN container
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    # ... VPN config
  
  cinephage:
    network_mode: service:gluetun
```

**Option 2: System VPN**
- Run VPN on your host
- Cinephage traffic goes through automatically

## Advanced Topics

### Can I use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite?

Not currently. Cinephage uses SQLite for simplicity. PostgreSQL support may be added in the future for very large libraries.

### Can I run multiple instances?

Not recommended. SQLite doesn't handle concurrent access well. If you need multiple instances, use separate databases.

### Is there an API?

Yes, but it's currently private and undocumented. Public API documentation will be released in the future.

### Can I contribute?

Yes! Cinephage is open source:
- 🐛 Report bugs on GitHub
- 💡 Suggest features
- 📝 Improve documentation
- 💻 Submit pull requests
